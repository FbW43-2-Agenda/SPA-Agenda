#### JavaScript:

Popup window in the screen center:

```
<input type="button" onclick="popupwindow('https://google.com','test',500,500);">
<script>
function popupwindow(url, title, w, h) {
  var left = (screen.width/2)-(w/2);
  var top = (screen.height/2)-(h/2);
  return window.open(url, title, 'toolbar=no, location=no, directories=no, status=no, menubar=no, scrollbars=no, resizable=no, copyhistory=no, width='+w+', height='+h+', top='+top+', left='+left);
}
</script>
```

#### Exercises:

Make a webpage that contains a button

1. When a visitor clicks on the button a new small window opens
2. The new window shows a login webpage (aka username and password)
3. control the credentials (e.g., username==admin, password=123456) when the results were true open a new window including a welcome message (e.g., welcome to your panel!)
4. if the authentication was false - > shows a webpage including a warning message with the visitor browser information (e.g., the message would be "you are not allowed to enter the user panel, now we collect your browser information
   and report to our IT security department!

- TIP: the visitor's information can be gained by the properties of the navigator object
